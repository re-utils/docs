    npm i ciorent
    ```
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem label='bun' icon='bun'>
    ```sh showLineNumbers=false
    bun i ciorent
    ```
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem label='pnpm' icon='pnpm'>
    ```sh showLineNumbers=false
    pnpm i ciorent
    ```

    ```
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

## Features
**ciorent** provides simple & optimized primitives for concurrency.

| Primitive | Description |
|---|---|
| [**Sleep**](../sleep) | Synchronous and asynchronous sleep functions. |
| [**Yield**](../yield) | Continue the execution of an asynchronous task on next tick, allowing other tasks to run. |
| [**Semaphore**](../semaphore) | Control access to a common resource by multiple tasks. |
| [**Latch**](../latch) | Allow asynchronous tasks to wait until another task completes an operation before continuing execution. |

## API
Import:
```ts
import {
  sleep, sleepSync, nextTick,
  semaphore, latch
} from 'ciorent';
```

### `sleep()`
- `ms: number` - Sleep duration in milliseconds.
- Returns `Promise<void>` - A `Promise` that resolves in `ms` milliseconds.

Sleep for `ms` milliseconds.

### `sleepSync()`
- `ms: number` - Sleep duration in milliseconds.

Sleep for `ms` milliseconds. This blocks the event loop.

### `nextTick`
Continue the async task on next microtick. Await this value is equivalent to await a resolved `Promise`.

### `semaphore`
A primitive used to control access to a common resource by multiple tasks.

#### `semaphore.init()`
- `n: number` - Number of permits.
- Returns `semaphore.Semaphore`

Create a semaphore with `n` permits.

#### `semaphore.acquire()`
- `sem: semaphore.Semaphore` - A semaphore to acquire a permit.
- Returns `Promise<void> | void`

Acquire a permit from `sem` or wait until a permit is available.

#### `semaphore.release()`
- `sem: semaphore.Semaphore` - A semaphore to release a permit.

Release a permit to `sem`.

### `latch`
A primitive that allows one task to wait until another task completes an operation before continuing execution.

#### `latch.init()`
- Returns `latch.Latch`

Create a closed latch.

#### `latch.open()`
- `c: latch.Latch` - The latch to open.

Unblock tasks that are waiting for `c` to open.

#### `latch.close()`
- `c: latch.Latch` - The latch to close.

Reclose a latch if it was opened.

#### `latch.wait()`
- `c: latch.Latch` - The latch to wait for.
- Returns `Promise<void> | void`

Wait for `c` to open.
