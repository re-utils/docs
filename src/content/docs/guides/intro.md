**re-utils** is a set of libraries optimized for size & performance while also provides excellent developer experience.

## Why re-utils?
Through years of dedicated engine optimizations, JS has transformed into a remarkably fast language. However, the ecosystem surrounding JavaScript  sometimes undermines this inherent speed. Libraries can be bloated with features you don't need, not tree-shake friendly, or API designs that led to worse performance.

**re-utils** delivers a suite of libraries built from the ground up with simplicity, developer experience, and performance in mind.
